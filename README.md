The website does not offer direct online purchasing functionality; instead, it directs customers to WhatsApp for placing orders. This approach maintains personal interaction with customers while still providing comprehensive product information online. The system prioritizes security with restricted access to administrative functions, ensuring content integrity while allowing for timely updates to product information and business details.
